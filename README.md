# django news
##### author: Brandon R. Stoner, (monokrome@monokro.me)[mailto:monokrome@monokro.me]

A django application for posting news. This works as a fairly
decent *news or blogging* application, and easily provides features
like comments, markup, and RSS and ATOM feeds at no cost.

This ties into the django user authentication system to allow multiple users to post, edit, and delete news articles on the web site.
